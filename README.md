# Shopify Backend Intern Challenge (Inventory Tracker) - Abdallah Hwishel
This is an inventory tracking web app that allows users to perform basic CRUD operations on any inventory items they want.

<b>No need to install anything, just visit the application link to use it :)</b>

<h2>NOTE: Since this uses the free tier in heroku for hosting, clicking the link to visit the app below may not work immediately and can take a few refreshes to get it to actually show the webpage. It takes a hot second for the heroku server hosting my app to wake up ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</h2>
